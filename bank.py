# Create a file in the classes directory, bank.py. Define the following classes 
# in the module respectively. 
# Account
# The class should have one class attribute and three instance variables.

# Add attributes deposits and withdrawals in the init method which are empty lists 
# by default and another attribute loan_balance which is zero by default.    

# Add a method check_balance which returns the account’s balance

# Update the deposit method to append each withdrawal transaction to the deposits list. Each 
# transaction should be in the form of a dictionary like this  
# {
#    "amount": amount,
#    "narration": “deposit”
# }

# Update the withdrawal method to append each withdrawal transaction to the withdrawals list. Each 
# transaction should be in the form of a dictionary like like this 
# {
#    "amount": amount,
#    "narration": “withdrawal”
# }

# Add a new method  print_statement which combines both deposits and withdrawals into one list and, 
# using a for loop, prints each transaction in a new line like this
# deposit - 1000
# withdrawal - 500


# Add a borrow_loan method which allows a customer to borrow if they meet these conditions:
# Account has no outstanding loan
# Loan amount requested is more than 100
# Customer has made at least 10 deposits.
# Amount requested is less than or equal to 1/3 of their total sum of all deposits.
# A successful loan increases the loan_balance by requested amount


# Add a repay_loan method with this functionality
# A customer can repay a loan to reduce the current loan_balance
# Overpayment of a loan increases the accounts current balance
